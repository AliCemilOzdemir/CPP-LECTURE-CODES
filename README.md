# CPP-LECTURE-CODES

The codes in this repository are compiled from the lecture slides of the CMP1001 course and the codes written during class.

## Which codes are included in the repository?

- Codes that are not too similar to each other, are not overly simple, and are found in the lecture slides have been included in this repository.

## Which codes are excluded from the repository?

1. **Codes for Definition Purposes:**
    - Codes that primarily serve as examples for definitions rather than executable scripts have been excluded. For example:
      ```cpp
      if ([boolean condition])
      {
          // commands
      }
      ```

2. **Similar Functioning Codes:**
    - Codes that are very similar and serve the same function are not included. For instance:
      - If a code only differs by using `cout << "\n";` instead of `cout << endl;` with the rest of the code being the same, it is not included in the repository.

3. **Single-Line Simple Codes:**
    - Some very basic and single-line codes are excluded. For example:
      ```cpp
      cout << 10 % 2 << endl;
      ```
